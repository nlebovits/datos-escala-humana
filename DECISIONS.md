## No Appendix with Definitions - 2026-01-28

**Context:** Educational materials often include appendices with definitions of technical terms used throughout the content.

**Decision:** We will not create an appendix with definitions for technical terms.

**Rationale:** Readers can easily search for unfamiliar terms using search engines or AI assistants. The effort required to maintain a comprehensive, accurate definitions appendix does not justify the return on investment, especially given the rapid evolution of terminology in data science and geospatial fields.

**Consequences:** Readers encountering unfamiliar terms will need to look them up independently. This keeps the content focused and reduces maintenance burden.
