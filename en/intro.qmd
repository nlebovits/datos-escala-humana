## About this book

_Human Scale Data_ explains how to use global datasets to manage climate risk in cities. This book is aimed at urban planners, municipal officials, and other decision-makers in resource-limited environments where high-quality local data is scarce or insufficient. While the tools taught in this book are meant to be useful in any city around the world, the primary emphasis is placed on under-resourced cities that would not otherwise have the resources to access high-quality climate data.

This book does not assume advanced Python or GIS knowledge. It aims to be an intensive course, not exhaustive, and provides resources for further exploration when possible. The goal of this work is not on mastering GIS programming but on providing replicable workflows that users can readily understand and apply in their own contexts to drive tangible municipal action.

## Organization

The book is organized into five main sections:

**Chapter 1: Python GIS**. This chapter covers the fundamentals of working with geospatial data in Python and a summary of the basic spatial operations we use in this book.

**Chapter 2: Open data**. This chapter explores the best sources of open data, different ways to access them, and why these tools are important. It delves into cloud-native data formats and different ways to access these datasets, plus evaluating their quality and suitability.

**Chapter 3: Climate risk**. This chapter defines what climate risk is, common climate hazards for cities, and the best available data sources. It covers how to calculate climate risk and some limitations in calculating it, given available datasets.

**Chapter 4: From data to action**. This chapter addresses how to link these datasets to concrete policies and infrastructure decisions to protect people from climate. It covers issues of governance, certainty, fitness for purpose, and heuristics.

**Cookbooks**. The Cookbooks section presents real-world case studies the author carried out in Argentina, along with the accompanying code to replicate them. As this project grows, we hope to incorporate more examples from around the world.

## Guiding principles

**Build community, not just tech.** Given the pace of technological change, much of the contents of this book will be outdated by the time it comes out. The goal of this book, therefore, is not to treat the book as a static resource, but to build a hub. We hope to bring together a community of practitioners and experts who will not only update and maintain this resource but eventually grow beyond it.

**Use data for decisions.** Our goal is not to provide an exhaustive list of available data or processing approaches, but to demonstrate how high quality open data can be used to support robust-decision making to reduce climate risk.

**Cloud-native by default.**
New cloud-native geospatial tools unlock efficient, low-cost, data processing at scale. This makes it possible for resource-constrained cities to get unprecedented access to high-quality global climate data. Workflows that were impossible five years ago can now be run for free in a matter of minutes. This book uses these tools by default, demonstrating that cloud-native is usually simpler, faster, and more powerful than legacy tools.
