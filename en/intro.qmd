# Introduction {.unnumbered}

🚧 **Project Status**: This book is currently in the early stages of development. We expect to complete a minimum viable product by the end of 2025. Check the [roadmap](/project/ROADMAP.md) for more information.

This book is largely based on the [Open Data for Resilient Cities](https://www.fau.unlp.edu.ar/posgrado/curso-datos-abiertos-para-ciudades-resilientes/) course that the author teaches at the Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning of the National University of La Plata during the final semester of 2025.

## About this book

_Human-Scale Data_ teaches how to leverage global datasets through cloud-native geospatial computing to mitigate climate risk in cities.

Primarily aimed at urban planners, municipal officials, architects, and technicians in resource-limited environments where high-quality local data is scarce or of insufficient quality. Does not assume advanced GIS knowledge. Intensive course, not exhaustive. We provide resources for deeper exploration. Action and simple, replicable workflows are the focus.

An evolving document, currently in minimum viable product phase. Not the final word, and we recognize it will become outdated without continued development.

Uses cloud-native geospatial technology. While relatively new, it's not difficult and makes things easier. We don't delve into theory but into applications. To learn more, see the [Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum](https://cloudnativegeo.org/).

Written first in Spanish because there are almost no Spanish-language resources on these topics. The author is not a native speaker and has used language models to support translation. If you find errors, open a ticket or contribute.

## Philosophy: practice over theory

We prioritize practice over theory. We balance the explanation of spatial concepts with their implementation. There will be cases where we don't delve into why we do something a certain way. We leave you to explore with language models or consult the documentation. We focus on doing.

We also prioritize concepts over techniques. We deliberately return to core techniques: you'll see spatial aggregation and zonal statistics repeatedly. We won't delve into advanced spatial statistics. We show the concepts and repeat them so they stick. The goal is not to create fully trained geospatial analysts, but to provide replicable workflows that you understand well enough to apply in your own context.

## Organization

The book is organized into four main sections:

**Chapter 1: GIS and Python crash course**. Covers the fundamentals of working with geospatial data in Python, both vector and raster, and a summary of the basic spatial operations we use in this book. We also provide resources for learning more about Python and GIS.

**Chapter 2: Open data**. Explores what the best sources of open data are, different ways to access these data, and why these tools are important. Delves a bit into cloud-native data formats and different ways to access these datasets, plus evaluating their quality and suitability. Addresses both epistemological and programming issues.

**Chapter 3: Climate risk**. We define what climate risk is, common climate risks for cities, and the best available data sources. We talk about how to calculate climate risk and some limitations in calculating it, given the available datasets.

**Chapter 4: Data to action**. Addresses how to take these datasets and link them to concrete policies and infrastructure decisions to protect people from climate. We address issues of governance, certainty, fitness for purpose, heuristics, etc.

**Cookbooks**. Chapters 1 through 4 are designed to be more pedagogical, focused on practice and learning tools and concepts. The Cookbooks section presents real-world examples of case studies the author carried out in Argentina during his Fulbright fellowship with real municipal governments, using real data to make real decisions. These examples demonstrate what's possible with the tools we explore in this book. We welcome contributions of additional examples from other contexts.
